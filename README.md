seat-inventory(https://github.com/recursivetree/seat-inventory)
This plugin aims to make the life of corporations and alliances easier by helping to manage contracts and corporation 
hangars. It loads contracts and corporation hangars from the ESI to make a list of what we have. 
Additionally, you can define what you need(e.g. a doctrine ship) and where you need it(staging). 
The plugin compares it to what you have and shows you how many times you have your doctrine ship stocked. 
It also shows you what's missing, so you can restock.

More features:
- notifications if your stocks run low
- dashboards to monitor doctrines consisting out of multiple ship types. You can even have one ship in multiple doctrine dashboards
- create stocks from fits from seat-fitting, changes through seat-fitting are reflected
- export missing items to seat-alliance-industry
- priorities: If there aren't enough items, preferably allocate them to high priority ships like a home-defence doctrine
- much more

The plugin isn't that easy to use, but I will write a documentation at some point.

It is likely that there are still some bugs. Don't hesitate to report them.
