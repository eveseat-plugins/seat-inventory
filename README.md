# seat-inventory
An upcoming inventory manager for seat. It is still in an experimental state, but if you feel adventurous, nothing stops
you from installing it. I currently give no guarantee that there won't be breaking changes, although I don't expect any.

## Installation
See the instruction over at the [seat documentation](https://eveseat.github.io/docs/community_packages/).

The package name is `recursivetree/seat-inventory`.
